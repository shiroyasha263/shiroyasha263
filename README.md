## Hey there !

### About me 

  I'm an electrical engineering undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur (2024 batch).
  My primary language is C++ but I can do C#, C, python.
  I'm interested in computer graphics, raytracing, light transport and simulations and looking forward to learn more.
  I've had a sudden interest surge in the field of computer architecture, the inner workings of operating systems, and GPU architecture.
  I'm pretty new around here and project count's low, but feel free to go through them and contribute. 

### I’m currently working on 
  
  - Path Tracer using OPTIX
  - Volumetric Rendering using photon mapping and photon beams
  - Virtual reality and Mixed Reality
  - OpenGL (And GLSL Shaders but not quite at the point to integrate fancy shaders with opengl code)
  - Game Development

### I’m currently learning 

  - Monte carlo methods and importance sampling
  - Computer architecture and Operating system
