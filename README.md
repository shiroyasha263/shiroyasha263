## Hey there !

### About me 

  I am currently working as a research assistant at Trinity College Dublin advised by Dr. Binh-Son Hua working on generative rendering - utilizing the broad pixel-space knowledge of 2D image-based diffusion models and applying them to accelerate and control our 3D image renderers. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering in 2024.

### Research Interests

  I am interested in computer graphics, and differetiable simulations for design problems; specifically light transport simulation, and trying to use that for designing lens.
