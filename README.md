## Hey there !

### About me 

  I am currently working as a research assistant at Trinity College Dublin advised by Dr. Binh-Son Hua working on generative rendering - utilizing the broad pixel-space knowledge of 2D image-based diffusion models and applying them to accelerate and control our 3D image renderers. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering in 2024.

### Research Interests

  My research interests include, but are not limited to generative rendering, physically-based (differentiable) rendering, inverse (graphics) problems and AI aided design. I am interested in developing numerical and optimization methods to simulate and engineer optical properties of lenses for applications in imaging and computational photography.
