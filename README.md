## Hey there !

### About me 

  I am currently interning at Max Planck Institute for Informatics advised by Dr. Gurprit Singh. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering in 2024.

### Research Interests

  I am interested in computer graphics; specifically light transport simulation, monte carlo sampling and real-time path tracing. I would also like to explore how to leverage latest machine learning research to improve rendering.
